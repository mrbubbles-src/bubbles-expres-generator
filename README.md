# bubbles-express-generator

A simple CLI to scaffold Express.js starter projects.

## 🔧 Usage

You can use the CLI via `npx` (no installation needed):

```bash
npx bubbles-express
```

Or install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g bubbles-express
bubbles-express
```

## 🧪 Variants

The generator supports different project types:

- **(Supabase) PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM + TypeScript**
- **MongoDB (Atlas) + Mongoose ODM + TypeScript**
- _(Vanilla JavaScript variants coming soon)_

## 📁 Output

A new folder will be created with the generated code based on your selections. After that, dependencies will be installed automatically.

Once it's done, you can start your project with:

```bash
cd your-project-name
npm run dev
```

You're ready to go!
